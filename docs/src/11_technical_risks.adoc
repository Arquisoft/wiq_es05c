== Risks and Technical Debts


=== Risks

==== Internal Risks
Risks that we can have under control and it´s our responsability to fight against them:
[options="header" frame=all]
|===
|Internal |More detail |How to fight it  

|A member fire out the project
|It's possible that due to reasons like having a lot of pressure or being overwhelmed by the project members of the group quit the project or the subject
|Try to communicate with each other and having a sensible rhythm advancing with the project. Also helping each other when we can

|First time delivering a full stack app
|We could have a lack of experience with a project as big as this that have a bit of every field.
|Searching and learning the new things we could need during the project and talking with the other members if we know more of a determined field trying to help them

|Lack of time 
|We can have some though weeks because we have other subjects to study and other projects and exams that can consumpt our time 
|Attemp to be responsible with our time and tasks and try to organize ourselves as good as we can

|New technologies
|Some technologies that we will use in the projects are new for us such as React or managing a database due to our lack of experience
|Learning the new things that we don't know and not being unwilling to confront new things such as technologies or languages that we have lack of experience on them

|Not accomplish deadlines
|It can happen that we don't archieve what it's requested into the project in time and end up sending an uncompleted final product or during the middle deadlines 
|To avoid this we have to keep a good rhythm advancing and planing good and adequated tasks in the weekly meetings done in the labs so we don't run out of time not done

==== External Risks
Risks that we can try to prevent but at the end doesn't depend on us:
[options="header" frame=all]
|===
|External risk |More detail |How to fight it  

|Depending on extern technologies
|It's possible that due to depend on external libraries such as react or external services like Azure we can find ourselves with the poject not working derivated from failures on that external technologies
|Try to investigate and use reliable services and libraries that are not likely to end up deprecated or with bugs and failures on their releases

|Accidents in the presentation day 
|Accidents can happen and if something like a train or bus not working or some unexpected problem that we can experience the presentation day (2nd May) it´s possible that someone can be absent in that final presentation
|To avoid this we should try to be cautious and arrive with a big margin time and having alternatives

|Malicious people
|Maybe people who spends all day looking for machines or url's that are vulnerable finds our machine and tries to break into it or obtain information (maybe already happened)
|We should implement what we are learning and already have learned about security and mantaining our systems save and sound.

=== Technical Debt

[options="header" frame=all]
|===
|Technical Debt |Description 

|Improve multiplayer gamemode
|There are some multiplayer aspects that can be improved such as functionallity and performance

|White label in login and register
|In the register and login area the label of the inputs can´t be put in white to contrast in the dark mode

|Some bugs in diverse gamemodes
|Some of the game modes have minor bugs that need to be deeply tested

|Improve ranking
|Make a ranking for each game mode or some idea similar

|Fullfill coverage
|We have the coverage around 80% so try to ascend that to 100%

|Fix the security hotspots
|Sonar Cloud mark diverse security hotspots so we could try to fix them

|Color change and language buttons frozen
|When in game we were forced to block those buttons because if you change them it restarted the timer and questions in game

|More languages
|At the moment we only have spanish and english translations so adding more languages is a good idea
